# What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter

## Description

This project aims to explain what happens under the hood when you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter. It explores the different layers of the web stack ‚Äî from DNS resolution to database interactions ‚Äî providing both a high-level overview and technical insight into the process.

## üß† Topics Covered

The blog post covers the following essential components of the request flow:

- **DNS Request**: How the domain name is translated into an IP address.
- **TCP/IP**: Establishing a reliable connection using the TCP protocol.
- **Firewall**: How firewalls inspect and filter incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Encryption using SSL/TLS to secure the communication.
- **Load Balancer**: Distribution of incoming requests across multiple servers.
- **Web Server**: Serving static and dynamic content (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
- **Application Server**: Running server-side logic (e.g., Node.js, Django).
- **Database**: Storage and retrieval of persistent data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
